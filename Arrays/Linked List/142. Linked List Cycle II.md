:) Logic
The logic is to keep two pointers slow and fast intialized to head node, Increment slow by 1 and fast by 2 once they 
encounter then take one another pointer intialized to head and move the new pointer as well as slow pointer by 1, the 
node where these two pointers will meet is ou answer i.e: the sarting point of cycle.

:) Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode *detectCycle(ListNode *head) {
        ListNode *res = NULL;
        if((head==NULL) || (head->next==NULL)) return res;
        ListNode *fast = head;
        ListNode *slow = head;
        while((fast->next != NULL) && (fast->next->next != NULL))
        {
           fast = fast->next->next;
           slow = slow->next;
        if(fast == slow)
        {
            ListNode *check = head;
            while(check != slow)
            {
                check=check->next;
                slow=slow->next;
            }
            return slow;
        }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
:) Complexity
T.C: O(N)
S.C: O(1)
